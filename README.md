## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starter Code | Prompts and questions | [Here](./Project-1-CC.ipynb) |
| Solution Code | Sample solutions for project 1 | [Here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/data-part-time/unit-project-solutions/blob/master/project-1/project-1_solutions.ipynb) |

> Note: Instructors should withhold providing project solutions until students have submitted their drafts. In order to do so, avoid forking this repo and instead clone down materials locally, create a new repository in your student org, and upload materials manually.

## Project Objective

We've provided a Jupyter notebook Project-1-CC.ipynb that contains the kinds of coding challenges that often come up in data science job interviews. In addition to preparing you for interviews, completing challenges like these is a fun way to develop your Python skills.

Some of these problems are well known, so it may be possible to find complete solutions online. Students should see these questions as an opportunity to challenge themselves; looking up answers limits the potential growth that comes from practice and repetition of these skills.

## Project Requirements

Create working solutions for all of the questions above.

Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question.
2. A working solution to each problem. Do not include test, practice, or broken code unless you were unable to create a working solution.
3. Comments for all of your code that explain your steps and describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.
4. **Bonus**: In programming (and life), there may be multiple ways to solve a problem. After completing our challenges, go back and see if you can think of any other valid methods!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.

## Submission

Your instructor will explain how to submit your assignment. Typically, this is done either by:

- Creating a repository in your github profile, hosting your materials, and sharing a link with your instructor.
[or]
- Forking the project repository, adding your solutions, and submitting a pull request back to the relevant repo.
