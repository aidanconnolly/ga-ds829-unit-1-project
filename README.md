## Project Objective

Technical interviews are a core component of being a data scientist. Moreover, they're a fun way to practice your new Python skills.

Below we've included three coding challenges. You should complete each of these in Python, and test your solutions to verify they work. You are encouraged to comment your code to so you can explain what is occuring at each step. (Many of these are common practice problems and, thus, solutions can be found online. You are discouraged from doing so as this only limits your own growth from solving these problems.)

## Sample Technical Interview Challenges

### Challenge 1: Largest Palindrome
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

### Challenge 2: Summation of primes
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

### Challenge 3: Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Challenge 4: Fizz Buzz
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Fizz", for multiples of 5 print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". Bonus: If that's too easy, create three unique solutions. Sometimes you'll encounter unexpected constraints, so make sure you're able to think creatively!

### Challenge 5: String Compressor
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string 'aabcccccaaa' would become a2b1c5a3. If the “compressed” string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z). Specify whether your solution is case sensitive or insensitive, and what you would need to change to make it the other.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the questions above.

Your notebook should include:

1. Text for the question, copy and pasted from this file (preferably in markdown).
2. A working solution to each problem.
  - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Provide comments for your code
  - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

4. **Bonus**: In programming and life, there are typically multiple equivalent methods of solving a problem. After completing these challenges, go back and try to think of any additional solutions.

### Rubric

For all projects, requirements should be evaluated on a simple 3 point scale (0, 1, or 2). 

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_

### How We Grade Projects

Instructors should use the following guidelines to provide project feedback:

1. Make a copy of the project requirements.
2. Use our rubric to assign students a point value for all required items.
3. Provide at least one comment for each requirement.

> We recommend using a "glow/grow" template, providing one item of praise and one suggestion for improvement for each requirement.
